... toil and trouble. Imagine you're a wizard and you run a bar. This is a game where you can do just that!
It was made as part of Global Game Jam 2025. A competition where you have 48 hours to make a video game.

## How to play
The game is hosted at [https://global-jam-25.izzy.kiwi/](https://global-jam-25.izzy.kiwi/). \
You can drag various ingredients into the cauldron. Each ingredient has a cost so you'll see your coin jar go down as you add things. To see the names and costs of ingredients, hover over them with your mouse.
When you're ready, click the spoon to brew it into a potion. This will then get sold and hopefully you'll earn your money back.
